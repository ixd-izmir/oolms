# oolms
Tired of looking out for a LMS that suit our purposes we decided to create our own system powered by javascript/node/electron.

The idea is to have a desktop application client to be given to the students from which they can access materials, quiz, and upload their contributions, as well as post question and (indirectly) improve the content of the course.
The contents (materials, exercises, tutorials, students' works) will be posted online on a specific ftp server.

The instructors will have their own desktop application client which allow them to upload materials verified the students' works with comments and evaluations. Some works (indipendently from their grade) can be selected for promotional purposes and published online to a drlf-generated gallery-website next to the online syllabus.

The evaluations will be visualized and collected with the comments to generate an evalation form to be given to the students at the end of the course.

Soon online, just started, stay tuned!
